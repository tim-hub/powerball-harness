Also use when the user wants to persist cross-session knowledge or search for previously recorded patterns. Do NOT load for: code implementation, code reviews, ad-hoc notes, or in-session task logging. Manages SSOT (Single Source of Truth) memory — decisions.md, patterns.md, cross-tool memory search, and memory sync."

## Unified Harness Memory (shared DB)

For recording and searching shared across Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode, prefer the `harness_mem_*` MCP tools.

- Search: `harness_mem_search`, `harness_mem_timeline`, `harness_mem_get_observations`
- Injection: `harness_mem_resume_pack`
- Recording: `harness_mem_record_checkpoint`, `harness_mem_finalize_session`, `harness_mem_record_event`

## Relationship with Claude Code Auto Memory (D22)

Harness SSOT memory (Layer 2) coexists with Claude Code's auto memory (Layer 1).
Auto memory implicitly records general learnings, while SSOT explicitly manages project-specific decisions.
When Layer 1 insights are important for the entire project, promote them to Layer 2 with `/memory ssot`.

Details: [D22: 3-Layer Memory Architecture](../../.claude/memory/decisions.md#d22-3-layer-memory-architecture)

## Execution Steps

1. Classify the user's request
2. Read the appropriate reference file from "Feature Details" above
3. Execute according to its contents

## SSOT Promotion

Persists important learnings from the memory system (Claude-mem / Serena) to SSOT.
