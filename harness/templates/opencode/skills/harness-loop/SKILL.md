# Harness Loop

Meta-skill that combines `/loop` (CC dynamic mode) with `ScheduleWakeup` to re-enter long-running tasks with a **fresh context on every wake-up**.

Each wake-up calls the worker agent via the Task tool, forming a re-entrant loop of 1 cycle = 1 task completion.

## Quick Reference

| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `/harness-loop all` | Loop all incomplete tasks (default: max 8 cycles) |
| `/harness-loop all --max-cycles 3` | Stop after 3 cycles |
| `/harness-loop 41.1-41.3 --pacing ci` | Execute task range with CI pacing |
| `/harness-loop all --pacing night` | Overnight batch (3600s interval) |
| `/harness-loop --no-advisor` | Disable advisor consultation at all trigger points |

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `all` | Target all incomplete tasks | - |
| `N-M` | Task number range | - |
| `--max-cycles N` | Maximum cycle count | `8` |
| `--pacing <mode>` | Wake-up interval mode | `worker` (270s) |
| `--advisor` | Enable advisor consultation (default) | enabled |
| `--no-advisor` | Disable advisor consultation at all trigger points | - |

### Pacing Values

| pacing | delaySeconds | Use case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `worker` | 270 | Immediately after Worker completion (within 5 min cache warm) |
| `ci` | 270 | Waiting for short CI jobs |
| `plateau` | 1200 | 20 min (retry interval after plateau detection) |
| `night` | 3600 | Long overnight batch |

> **Constraint**: `ScheduleWakeup`'s `delaySeconds` is clamped to **[60, 3600]** at runtime.
> All pacing values are within this range.

## Launch Flow (per wake-up entry)

```
wake-up
  │
  ▼
[Step 0] Flock-based concurrency guard
  Prevent concurrent loop instances via lock directory
  │
  ▼
[Step 0.5] State consistency check
  bash tests/validate-plugin.sh --quick
  │
  ▼
[Step 1] Read Plans.md first
  Identify the leading cc:WIP / cc:TODO task (get task_id)
  No incomplete tasks → loop ends (normal completion)
  │
  ▼
[Step 2] Check sprint-contract existence & generate
  Check .claude/state/contracts/${task_id}.sprint-contract.json
  If absent: node harness/scripts/generate-sprint-contract.js ${task_id}
  On first generation: bash harness/scripts/enrich-sprint-contract.sh <contract-path> \
    --check "auto-approve (harness-loop)" --approve
  │
  ▼
[Step 3] Contract readiness check
  bash harness/scripts/ensure-sprint-contract-ready.sh <contract-path>
  │
  ▼
[Step 4] Resume pack reload
  harness-mem resume-pack (context re-injection)
  │
  ▼
[Step 5] Execute 1 task cycle
  worker_result = Agent(
      subagent_type="claude-code-harness:worker",
      prompt="Task: ${task_id}\nDoD: <extracted from Plans.md>\ncontract_path: ${CONTRACT_PATH}\nmode: breezing",
      isolation="worktree",
      run_in_background=false
  )
  # worker_result: { commit, branch, worktreePath, files_changed, summary }
  │
  ▼
[Step 5.5] Lead review execution
  diff_text = git show worker_result.commit
  verdict = codex_exec_review(diff_text) or reviewer_agent_review(diff_text)
  │
  ▼
[Step 5.6] APPROVE → cherry-pick to main / REQUEST_CHANGES → fix loop (max 3 iterations)
  APPROVE: git cherry-pick → update Plans.md to cc:Done [{hash}] → delete feature branch
  REQUEST_CHANGES x MAX_REVIEWS still rejected: escalation
  │
  ▼
[Step 6] Plateau detection
  bash harness/scripts/detect-review-plateau.sh ${current_task_id}
  │
  ├── PIVOT_REQUIRED (exit 2)   → loop stop + advisor call + user escalation
  ├── INSUFFICIENT_DATA (exit 1) → continue
  └── PIVOT_NOT_REQUIRED (exit 0) → continue
  │
  ▼
[Step 7] Cycle count check
  cycles >= max_cycles → loop stop (limit reached)
  │
  ▼
[Step 8] Record checkpoint
  harness_mem_record_checkpoint(session_id, title, content=cycle result summary)
  │
  ▼
[Step 9] Schedule next wake-up
  ScheduleWakeup(
      delaySeconds=<pacing value>,
      prompt="/harness-loop <same args>",
      reason="Cycle {N}/{max} complete — proceeding to next task"
  )
```

## Cycle Stop Conditions

| Condition | Stop Type | Response |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| `cycles >= max_cycles` | Normal stop (limit reached) | Report to user |
| `PIVOT_REQUIRED` (exit 2) | Abnormal stop (escalation) | Ask user for decision |
| No incomplete tasks | Normal stop (all complete) | Output completion report |

## Advisor Integration

When advisor consultation is enabled (default), the loop calls `run-advisor-consultation.sh` at three trigger points. On a `STOP` response the loop exits immediately with a summary.

### 1. Pre-task Risk Check

**Trigger**: Before starting any task annotated with `<!-- advisor:required -->` in Plans.md.
**Reason code**: `high_risk_preflight`

### 2. Post-plateau

**Trigger**: When `detect-review-plateau.sh` returns exit 2 (`PIVOT_REQUIRED`).
**Reason code**: `plateau_before_escalation`

### 3. Pre-escalation

**Trigger**: Before surfacing any STOP/failure to the user.
**Reason code**: `pre_user_escalation`

## /loop Integration

This skill is used in combination with CC's `/loop` (dynamic mode).
`/loop` sentinel: `<<autonomous-loop-dynamic>>`

Each wake-up starts with a **fresh context** — `harness-mem resume-pack` reload (Step 4) is required.

## Checkpoint Schema

```json
{
  "session_id": "<session ID>",
  "title": "harness-loop cycle {N}/{max}: {task name}",
  "content": "1-line summary of cycle_result + commit hash"
}
```
