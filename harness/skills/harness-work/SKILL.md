# Harness Work

Unified execution skill for Harness.
Consolidates the following legacy skills:

- `work` — Plans.md task implementation (auto scope detection)
- `impl` — Feature implementation (task-based)
- `breezing` — Full team auto-execution
- `parallel-workflows` — Parallel workflow optimization
- `ci` — CI failure recovery

## Quick Reference

| User Input | Subcommand | Behavior |
|------------|------------|----------|
| `harness-work` | **auto** | Auto-selects based on task count (see below) |
| `harness-work all` | **auto** | Executes all incomplete tasks in auto mode |
| `harness-work 3` | solo | Immediately executes task 3 only |
| `harness-work --parallel 5` | parallel | Forces parallel execution with 5 workers |
| `harness-work --codex` | codex | Delegates to Codex CLI (explicit only) |
| `harness-work --breezing` | breezing | Forces team execution |

## Execution Mode Auto Selection (auto-selection when no flag is specified)

When no explicit mode flag (`--parallel`, `--breezing`, `--codex`) is provided,
the optimal mode is automatically selected based on the number of target tasks:

| Target Task Count | Auto-Selected Mode | Reason |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **1 task** | Solo | Minimal overhead. Direct implementation is fastest |
| **2-3 tasks** | Parallel (Task tool) | Threshold where Worker isolation benefits emerge |
| **4+ tasks** | Breezing | Lead coordination + Worker parallelism + Reviewer independence is effective |

### Rules

1. **Explicit flags always override auto mode**
   - `--parallel N` → Parallel mode (regardless of task count)
   - `--breezing` → Breezing mode (regardless of task count)
   - `--codex` → Codex mode (regardless of task count)
2. **`--codex` activates only when explicitly specified**. Not auto-selected because Codex CLI may not be installed in some environments
3. `--codex` can be combined with other modes: `--codex --breezing` → Codex + Breezing

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `all` | Target all incomplete tasks | - |
| `N` or `N-M` | Task number/range specification | - |
| `--parallel N` | Number of parallel workers | auto |
| `--sequential` | Force sequential execution | - |
| `--codex` | Delegate implementation to Codex CLI (explicit only, not auto-selected) | false |
| `--no-commit` | Suppress auto-commit | false |
| `--resume <id\|latest>` | Resume previous session | - |
| `--breezing` | Lead/Worker/Reviewer team execution | false |
| `--no-tdd` | Skip TDD phase | false |
| `--no-simplify` | Skip Auto-Refinement | false |
| `--auto-mode` | Explicitly enable Auto Mode rollout. Only considered when the parent session's permission mode is compatible | false |
| `--advisor` | Enable advisor consultation (overrides config) | from config |
| `--no-advisor` | Disable advisor consultation | false |

> **Token Optimization (v2.1.69+)**: For lightweight tasks that don't involve git operations,
> enable `includeGitInstructions: false` in plugin settings to
> reduce prompt token usage.

> **1-Hour Prompt Cache** (breezing sessions > 30 min): `source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/enable-1h-cache.sh"` before starting. Exports `ANTHROPIC_CACHE_CONTROL=max-age=3600` so all spawned Workers, Reviewers, and hooks share a cached system prompt — reduces token cost and latency across long sessions.

## Scope Dialog (when no arguments provided)

> **Note**: A lightweight drift check (`bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/plans-drift-check.sh"`) runs before the scope dialog regardless of which option the user chooses. If stale markers are detected, the dialog is preceded by a drift summary and a confirmation prompt.

```
harness-work
How far do you want to go?
1) Next task: The next incomplete task in Plans.md → Execute in Solo mode
2) All (recommended): Complete all remaining tasks → Auto-select mode based on task count
3) Specify numbers: Enter task numbers (e.g., 3, 5-7) → Auto-select mode based on count
```

If arguments are provided, execute immediately (skip dialog):
- `harness-work all` → All tasks, auto mode selection
- `harness-work 3-6` → 4 tasks, so Breezing is auto-selected

## Effort Level Control (v2.1.68+, simplified in v2.1.72)

Claude Code v2.1.68 sets **medium effort** (`◐`) as default for Opus 4.6.
v2.1.72 removed the `max` level, simplifying to 3 levels: `low(○)/medium(◐)/high(●)`.
`/effort auto` resets to default.
For complex tasks, use the `ultrathink` keyword to enable high effort (`●`).

### Multi-Factor Scoring

At task start, the following scores are summed, and **ultrathink is injected when the threshold reaches 3 or above**:

| Factor | Condition | Score |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| File count | 4+ files to be changed | +1 |
| Directory | Includes core/, guardrails/, security/ | +1 |
| Keywords | Contains architecture, security, design, migration | +1 |
| Failure history | Agent memory contains failure records for the same task | +2 |
| Explicit specification | PM template includes ultrathink notation | +3 (auto-adopted) |

### Injection Method

When score >= 3, prepend `ultrathink` to the Worker spawn prompt.
The same logic applies in breezing mode (managed centrally by harness-work).

## Execution Modes

| Mode | Reference | When |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Solo** | [`references/solo-mode.md`](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/solo-mode.md) | 1 task (auto) or any task number |
| **Parallel** | [`references/parallel-mode.md`](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/parallel-mode.md) | 2-3 tasks (auto) or `--parallel N` |
| **Breezing** | [`references/breezing-mode.md`](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/breezing-mode.md) | 4+ tasks (auto) or `--breezing` |
| **Codex** | [`references/codex-work.md`](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/codex-work.md) | `--codex` explicit only |
| **Ralph** | `harness-ralph-loop` skill | Task has `[ralph]` marker — pre-dispatch, any mode |

> **`[ralph]` marker pre-dispatch rule**: Before any standard worker dispatch (solo or breezing),
> harness-work checks the task description for the `[ralph]` marker. If present, it delegates to
> `harness-ralph-loop` instead of the standard worker flow. Ralph tasks serialize within a session
> (only one Ralph loop runs at a time). See [`references/solo-mode.md`](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/solo-mode.md)
> and [`references/breezing-mode.md`](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/breezing-mode.md) for dispatch details.
