# Harness Plan

## Bootstrap Check (runs before any subcommand)

Before executing any subcommand, ensure the JSON plans storage is initialised:

1. If `.claude/harness/plans.json` exists → proceed normally.
2. If `Plans.md` exists but `.claude/harness/plans.json` does not → auto-migrate:
   ```bash
   harness plan-cli migrate
   ```
3. If neither exists → no action needed; the JSON file is created automatically on the first write (`harness plan-cli add-phase ...`).

This check is performed silently. Inform the user only if migration was triggered.

## Quick Reference

| User Input | Subcommand | Behavior |
|------------|------------|----------|
| "create a plan" | `create` | Default behavior, interactive interview → Plans.md generation |
| "add a task" | `add` | Add new task to Plans.md |
| "mark complete" | `update` | Change task marker to cc:done |
| "where am I?" / "check progress" / `harness-plan sync` / "sync status"| `sync` | Compare implementation with Plans.md and sync |
| `harness-plan sync --snapshot` | `sync --snapshot` | Save point-in-time progress snapshot |
| "rough idea" / "brainstorm" / `harness-plan brainstorm` | `brainstorm` | Shape idea → design spec → Plans.md tasks |
| "archive old phases" / `harness-plan archive` | `archive` | Archive phases in Plans.md to `.claude/memory/archive/`; update `Last archive:` line in the `## Archive` footer |
| "session log too big" / `harness-plan session-log` | `session-log` | Split session-log.md by month; move older months to `.claude/memory/session-log-YYYY-MM.md` |

## Subcommand Details

Each subcommand has its own reference file. Open the matching file when invoking that subcommand.

| Subcommand | Reference |
|------------|-----------|
| `create` | [references/create.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/create.md) — interview flow, TDD decision rules, Plans.md generation |
| `add` | [references/add.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/add.md) — insertion rules, DoD/Depends auto-inference |
| `update` | [references/update.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/update.md) — marker mapping, single-task status changes |
| `sync` | [references/sync.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/sync.md) — discrepancy detection, retrospective, --snapshot |
| `brainstorm` | [references/brainstorm.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/brainstorm.md) — two-stage idea → spec → plan flow |
| `archive` | [references/archive.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/archive.md) — phase archival, retention, naming |
| `session-log` | [references/session-log.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/session-log.md) — monthly split of session-log.md |
| _(CLI reference)_ | [references/cli-reference.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/cli-reference.md) — all subcommands, flags, exit codes, agent examples |
| _(quality gate)_ | [references/planning-quality.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/planning-quality.md) — 8-step planning quality contract for `create` and high-impact `add` |

**CI mode** (`--ci`) — applies to `create` only: no interview; uses existing Plans.md and only performs task decomposition. See [references/create.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/create.md) "CI Mode" section.

**Retrospective skip** (`--no-retro`) — applies to `sync` only: skips the automatic retrospective pass. See [references/sync.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/sync.md) "Step 6: Retrospective".

## Plans Format Conventions

Task data is stored in `.claude/harness/plans.json`. The canonical schema is defined in `plan_types.go`. Key invariants:

- **Newest phase first** — `add-phase` prepends; phases are listed newest-on-top.
- **Phases are never reordered** — gaps in IDs are allowed (archived phases are soft-deleted via `status: archived`).
- **DoD must be verifiable** — yes/no answerable; banned: "looks good", "works properly".
- **All writes go through the CLI** — never edit `plans.json` directly; use `harness plan-cli` subcommands.

## Marker List

Compact summary. For full semantics (including the `cc:done [hash]` artifact format and `blocked` reason annotation), see [references/plans-md-rules.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/plans-md-rules.md) "Status markers".

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pm:requested` | Requested by PM |
| `cc:TODO` | Not started |
| `cc:WIP` | In progress |
| `cc:done` | Worker completed |
| `pm:confirmed` | PM review completed |
| `blocked` | Blocked (reason must always be noted) |
| `[ralph]` | Iterative loop task — executed by `harness-ralph-loop`; requires `Verify:` line. See [references/ralph-tasks.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/ralph-tasks.md) |

## Optional Briefs / Manifest

`harness-plan create` attaches briefs only when needed.

- Tasks involving UI get a `design brief`
- Tasks involving API get a `contract brief`
- Briefs are supplementary materials that briefly define what to build; they do not replace Plans.md
- A machine-readable JSON list of skill frontmatter can be generated with `scripts/generate-skill-manifest.sh`

- `docs/plans/briefs-manifest.md`

## Delegation to `harness-planner` Agent

For mechanical plans mutations (mark task status, add a row, archive completed phases, split session-log), skills and agents may delegate to the **`harness-planner` agent** (Haiku, low effort) instead of running the edit inline.

The planner agent now calls the `harness plan-cli` binary — it **does not edit Plans.md or `plans.json` directly**. All writes go through the CLI so atomic I/O guarantees are preserved.

| Subcommand handled by agent | CLI call used internally |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `update` | `harness plan-cli update <task_id> --status <status>` |
| `add` | `harness plan-cli add-phase` or `harness plan-cli add-task <phaseID>` |
| `archive` | `harness plan-cli archive <phaseID>` |
| `session-log` | No CLI equivalent; still edits session-log.md directly |

Subcommands **not** delegated (require Opus reasoning, stay in this skill): `create`, `brainstorm`, `sync`.

**Invocation pattern** — callers use the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "harness-planner"` and pass a `planner-request.v1` JSON payload. The agent returns a `planner-response.v1` JSON. See [`harness/agents/harness-planner.md`](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../agents/harness-planner.md) for the full schema and per-operation flows.

The `harness-plan` skill itself remains the user-facing entry point — delegation is opt-in for callers that want cheap, deterministic edits without burning Opus tokens.

## Team Mode / Issue Bridge

Plans.md is maintained as the source of truth, and GitHub Issue integration is only used in opt-in team mode.

- Do not use the bridge for solo development
- Team mode creates one tracking issue and generates dry-run sub-issue payloads for each task underneath it
- `scripts/plans-issue-bridge.sh` does not actually update GitHub; it always returns dry-run payloads
- This bridge does not modify Plans.md
