# Harness Work

Unified execution skill for Harness.
Consolidates the following legacy skills:

- `work` — Plans.md task implementation (auto scope detection)
- `impl` — Feature implementation (task-based)
- `breezing` — Full team auto-execution
- `parallel-workflows` — Parallel workflow optimization
- `ci` — CI failure recovery

## Quick Reference

| User Input | Mode | Behavior |
|------------|------|----------|
| `harness-work` | **auto** | Auto-selects based on task count (see below) |
| `harness-work all` | **auto** | Executes all incomplete tasks in auto mode |
| `harness-work 3` | solo | Immediately executes task 3 only |
| `harness-work --parallel 5` | parallel | Forces parallel execution with 5 workers |
| `harness-work --codex` | codex | Delegates to Codex CLI (explicit only) |
| `harness-work --breezing` | breezing | Forces team execution |

## Execution Mode Auto Selection (auto-selection when no flag is specified)

When no explicit mode flag (`--parallel`, `--breezing`, `--codex`) is provided,
the optimal mode is automatically selected based on the number of target tasks:

| Target Task Count | Auto-Selected Mode | Reason |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **1 task** | Solo | Minimal overhead. Direct implementation is fastest |
| **2-3 tasks** | Parallel (Task tool) | Threshold where Worker isolation benefits emerge |
| **4+ tasks** | Breezing | Lead coordination + Worker parallelism + Reviewer independence is effective |

### Rules

1. **Explicit flags always override auto mode**
   - `--parallel N` → Parallel mode (regardless of task count)
   - `--breezing` → Breezing mode (regardless of task count)
   - `--codex` → Codex mode (regardless of task count)
2. **`--codex` activates only when explicitly specified**. Not auto-selected because Codex CLI may not be installed in some environments
3. `--codex` can be combined with other modes: `--codex --breezing` → Codex + Breezing

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `all` | Target all incomplete tasks | - |
| `N` or `N-M` | Task number/range specification | - |
| `--parallel N` | Number of parallel workers | auto |
| `--sequential` | Force sequential execution | - |
| `--codex` | Delegate implementation to Codex CLI (explicit only, not auto-selected) | false |
| `--no-commit` | Suppress auto-commit | false |
| `--resume <id\|latest>` | Resume previous session | - |
| `--breezing` | Lead/Worker/Reviewer team execution | false |
| `--no-tdd` | Skip TDD phase | false |
| `--no-simplify` | Skip Auto-Refinement | false |
| `--auto-mode` | Explicitly enable Auto Mode rollout. Only considered when the parent session's permission mode is compatible | false |

> **Token Optimization (v2.1.69+)**: For lightweight tasks that don't involve git operations,
> enable `includeGitInstructions: false` in plugin settings to
> reduce prompt token usage.

## Scope Dialog (when no arguments provided)

```
harness-work
How far do you want to go?
1) Next task: The next incomplete task in Plans.md → Execute in Solo mode
2) All (recommended): Complete all remaining tasks → Auto-select mode based on task count
3) Specify numbers: Enter task numbers (e.g., 3, 5-7) → Auto-select mode based on count
```

If arguments are provided, execute immediately (skip dialog):
- `harness-work all` → All tasks, auto mode selection
- `harness-work 3-6` → 4 tasks, so Breezing is auto-selected

## Effort Level Control (v2.1.68+, simplified in v2.1.72)

Claude Code v2.1.68 sets **medium effort** (`◐`) as default for Opus 4.6.
v2.1.72 removed the `max` level, simplifying to 3 levels: `low(○)/medium(◐)/high(●)`.
`/effort auto` resets to default.
For complex tasks, use the `ultrathink` keyword to enable high effort (`●`).

### Multi-Factor Scoring

At task start, the following scores are summed, and **ultrathink is injected when the threshold reaches 3 or above**:

| Factor | Condition | Score |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| File count | 4+ files to be changed | +1 |
| Directory | Includes core/, guardrails/, security/ | +1 |
| Keywords | Contains architecture, security, design, migration | +1 |
| Failure history | Agent memory contains failure records for the same task | +2 |
| Explicit specification | PM template includes ultrathink notation | +3 (auto-adopted) |

### Injection Method

When score >= 3, prepend `ultrathink` to the Worker spawn prompt.
The same logic applies in breezing mode (managed centrally by harness-work).

## Execution Mode Details

### Solo Mode (auto-selected for 1 task)

1. Read Plans.md and identify the target task
   - **If Plans.md does not exist**: Auto-invoke `harness-plan create --ci` → Generate Plans.md and continue
   - If header lacks DoD / Depends columns: `Plans.md is in the old format. Please regenerate with harness-plan create.` → **Stop**
   - **If the conversation contains unlisted tasks**: Extract requirements from the recent conversation context and auto-append to Plans.md as `cc:TODO`
     - Extraction logic: Detect action verbs from user statements ("add...", "fix...", "implement...")
     - Appended entries conform to v2 format (Task / Content / DoD / Depends / Status)
     - After appending, display "Added the following to Plans.md" with a 5-second timeout prompt (default: continue)
1.5. **Task Background Check** (30 seconds):
   - Infer and display the **purpose** (the problem this task solves) in one line from the task's "Content" and "DoD"
   - Use `git grep` / `Glob` to infer and display the **impact scope** (files/modules affected by changes)
   - If confident in the inference: proceed directly to implementation (no flow delay)
   - If not confident: ask the user one question only ("Is this understanding correct?")
2. Update task to `cc:WIP`
3. **TDD Phase** (when `[skip:tdd]` is absent & test framework exists):
   a. Create test file first (Red)
   b. Confirm failure
4. Generate `sprint-contract.json` with `scripts/generate-sprint-contract.sh <task-id>`
5. Add Reviewer perspective with `scripts/enrich-sprint-contract.sh` and confirm approved status with `scripts/ensure-sprint-contract-ready.sh`
6. Implement code (Green) (Read/Write/Edit/Bash)
7. Auto-Refinement with `/simplify` (skip with `--no-simplify`)
8. **Auto Review Stage** (see "Review Loop"):
   - Execute review with Codex exec priority → fallback to internal Reviewer agent
   - If `sprint-contract.json`'s `reviewer_profile` is `runtime`, execute `scripts/run-contract-review-checks.sh`
   - On REQUEST_CHANGES: fix based on feedback → re-review (up to 3 times)
   - Proceed to next step on APPROVE. Self-check alone does not confirm completion
9. Normalize and save review artifact with `scripts/write-review-result.sh`
10. Auto-commit with `git commit` (skip with `--no-commit`)
11. Update task to `cc:Done` (with commit hash)
   - Get the latest commit hash (abbreviated 7 chars) with `git log --oneline -1`
   - Update Plans.md Status to `cc:Done [a1b2c3d]` format
   - If no commit (`--no-commit`), use `cc:Done` without hash
12. **Rich Completion Report** (see "Completion Report Format")
13. **Automatic Re-ticketing on Failure** (test/CI failure only):
    - Check test execution results
    - On failure: save fix task proposal to state, add to Plans.md via approval command (see "Automatic Re-ticketing of Failed Tasks")
    - On success: proceed to next task

### Parallel Mode (auto-selected for 2-3 tasks / forced with `--parallel N`)

Execute `[P]`-marked tasks with N workers in parallel.
When explicitly specified with `--parallel N`, this mode is used regardless of task count.
If write conflicts to the same file occur, isolate with git worktree.

### Codex Mode (`--codex` explicit only)

Delegate tasks to Codex CLI via the official plugin `codex-plugin-cc` companion.

```bash
# Task delegation (writable)
bash scripts/codex-companion.sh task --write "task content"

# Via stdin (for large prompts)
CODEX_PROMPT=$(mktemp /tmp/codex-prompt-XXXXXX.md)
# Write task content
cat "$CODEX_PROMPT" | bash scripts/codex-companion.sh task --write
rm -f "$CODEX_PROMPT"

# Resume previous thread
bash scripts/codex-companion.sh task --resume-last --write "continue where we left off"
```

The companion communicates with Codex via the App Server Protocol,
providing job management, thread resume, and structured output.
Results are verified, and if quality standards are not met, fixes are applied independently.

### Breezing Mode (auto-selected for 4+ tasks / forced with `--breezing`)

Team execution with Lead / Worker / Reviewer role separation.
In Codex, this assumes native subagent orchestration using `spawn_agent`, `wait`, `send_input`, `resume_agent`, `close_agent`,
and does not follow the old TeamCreate / TaskCreate-based approach.

**Permission Policy**:
- The current shipped default is `bypassPermissions`
- `--auto-mode` is treated as an opt-in rollout flag for compatible parent sessions
- Do not write the undocumented `autoMode` value to `permissions.defaultMode` or agent frontmatter `permissionMode`

> **CC v2.1.69+**: Nested teammates are prohibited by the platform,
> so do not add redundant nested prevention wording to Worker/Reviewer prompts.

```
Lead (this agent)
├── Worker (task-worker agent) — Implementation
└── Reviewer (code-reviewer agent) — Review
```

**Phase A: Pre-delegate (Preparation)**:
1. Read Plans.md and identify target tasks
2. Analyze the dependency graph and determine execution order (Depends column)
3. Effort scoring for each task (ultrathink injection decision)
4. Generate `sprint-contract.json` with `scripts/generate-sprint-contract.sh`
5. Add Reviewer perspective with `scripts/enrich-sprint-contract.sh` and stop if unapproved with `scripts/ensure-sprint-contract-ready.sh`

**Phase B: Delegate (Worker spawn → review → cherry-pick)**:

Execute the following **sequentially** for each task (in dependency order):

> **API Note**: The following is written in Claude Code API syntax.
> In Codex environments, read `Agent(...)` as `spawn_agent(...)`, `SendMessage(...)` as `send_input(...)`.
> See the API mapping table in `team-composition.md` for details.

        diff_text = git("-C", worker_result.worktreePath, "show", latest_commit)
        verdict = codex_exec_review(diff_text) or reviewer_agent_review(diff_text)
        review_count++

    # B-5. APPROVE → cherry-pick to main
    if verdict == "APPROVE":

        git commit -m "{task.content}"
        Plans.md: task.status = "cc:Done [{hash}]"
    else:
        → Escalate to user

    # B-6. Progress feed
    print("📊 Progress: Task {completed}/{total} done — {task.content}")
```

### Sprint Contract

A `sprint-contract` is a small contract file that defines "what passes this task" in a format readable by both machines and humans.
The default storage location is `.claude/state/contracts/<task-id>.sprint-contract.json`.

```bash
scripts/generate-sprint-contract.sh 32.1.1
```

The generated artifact includes:

- `checks`: Verification items decomposed from the DoD
- `non_goals`: What is out of scope for this task
- `runtime_validation`: Validation commands such as test, lint, typecheck
- `browser_validation`: UI flow verification items for the browser reviewer
- `browser_mode`: `scripted` or `exploratory`
- `route`: Whether the browser reviewer uses `playwright` / `agent-browser` / `chrome-devtools`
- `risk_flags`: `needs-spike`, `security-sensitive`, `ux-regression`, etc.
- `reviewer_profile`: `static`, `runtime`, `browser`

**Phase C: Post-delegate (Integration & Reporting)**:
1. Aggregate commit logs for all tasks
2. Output a **Rich Completion Report** (Breezing template from "Completion Report Format")
3. Final check of Plans.md (verify all tasks are cc:Done)

## CI Failure Handling

When CI fails:

1. Check logs and identify the error
2. Implement fixes
3. Stop the auto-fix loop after 3 failures from the same cause
4. Summarize failure logs, attempted fixes, and remaining issues for escalation

## Automatic Re-ticketing of Failed Tasks

When tests/CI fail after task completion, auto-generate fix task proposals and reflect them in Plans.md after approval:

### Trigger Conditions

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Test failure after `cc:Done` | Save fix task proposal to state and wait for approval |
| CI failure (fewer than 3 times) | Implement fix and increment failure count |
| CI failure (3rd time) | Present fix task proposal + escalate |

### Auto-Generation of Fix Tasks

1. Classify failure cause (syntax_error / import_error / type_error / assertion_error / timeout / runtime_error)
2. Save fix task proposal to `.claude/state/pending-fix-proposals.jsonl`:
   - Number: Original task number + `.fix` suffix (e.g., `26.1.fix`)
   - Content: `fix: [original task name] - [failure cause category]`
   - DoD: Tests/CI pass
   - Depends: Original task number
3. When user sends `approve fix <task_id>`, add to Plans.md as `cc:TODO`
4. `reject fix <task_id>` discards the proposal. When there is only one pending item, `yes` / `no` responses are also accepted

## Review Loop

A quality verification stage that runs automatically after implementation completion (after step 5).
Applied uniformly across **all modes** (Solo / Parallel / Breezing).
In Parallel mode, each Worker executes the same loop as step 10 (external review acceptance).

### Review Execution Priority

```
1. Codex exec (priority)
   ↓ codex command does not exist or timeout (120s)
2. Internal Reviewer agent (fallback)
```

### APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES Verdict Criteria

The following threshold criteria are provided to reviewers, and the verdict is determined **solely by these criteria**.
Improvement suggestions outside these criteria are returned as `recommendations` but do not affect the verdict.

| Severity | Definition | Verdict Impact |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **critical** | Security vulnerabilities, data loss risk, potential production incidents | 1 item → REQUEST_CHANGES |
| **major** | Breaking existing functionality, clear contradiction with specifications, test failures | 1 item → REQUEST_CHANGES |
| **minor** | Naming improvements, insufficient comments, style inconsistencies | No impact on verdict |
| **recommendation** | Best practice suggestions, future improvement ideas | No impact on verdict |

> **Important**: When only minor / recommendation items exist, **always return APPROVE**.
> "Nice-to-have improvements" are not grounds for REQUEST_CHANGES.

### Codex Exec Review (via official plugin)

Record the HEAD at task start as `BASE_REF` and review the diff against that ref.
Uses the official plugin `codex-plugin-cc` companion review.

```bash
# Record base ref at task start (execute before cc:WIP update in Step 2)
BASE_REF=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# ... after implementation completion ...

# Execute structured review via official plugin
bash scripts/codex-companion.sh review --base "${BASE_REF}"
REVIEW_EXIT=$?
```

**Verdict Mapping** (official plugin → Harness format):

The official plugin returns structured output conforming to `review-output.schema.json`.
Conversion rules to Harness verdict format:

| Official Plugin | Harness | Verdict Impact |
|---|---|---|
| `approve` | `APPROVE` | - |
| `needs-attention` | `REQUEST_CHANGES` | - |
| `findings[].severity: critical` | `critical_issues[]` | 1 item → REQUEST_CHANGES |
| `findings[].severity: high` | `major_issues[]` | 1 item → REQUEST_CHANGES |
| `findings[].severity: medium/low` | `recommendations[]` | No impact on verdict |

AI Residuals scan continues to be executed with `scripts/review-ai-residuals.sh`,
and the final verdict is determined by combining its results with the companion review.

```bash
# AI Residuals scan (can run in parallel with companion review)
AI_RESIDUALS_JSON="$(bash scripts/review-ai-residuals.sh --base-ref "${BASE_REF}" 2>/dev/null || echo '{"tool":"review-ai-residuals","scan_mode":"diff","base_ref":null,"files_scanned":[],"summary":{"verdict":"APPROVE","major":0,"minor":0,"recommendation":0,"total":0},"observations":[]}')"
```

### Internal Reviewer Agent Fallback

When Codex exec is unavailable (`command -v codex` fails, or exit code != 0):

```
Agent tool: subagent_type="reviewer"
prompt: "Please review the following changes. Verdict criteria: critical/major → REQUEST_CHANGES, minor/recommendation only → APPROVE. diff: {git diff ${BASE_REF}}"
```

The Reviewer agent executes reviews safely in Read-only mode (Write/Edit/Bash disabled).

### Fix Loop (on REQUEST_CHANGES)

```
review_count = 0
MAX_REVIEWS = 3

while verdict == "REQUEST_CHANGES" and review_count < MAX_REVIEWS:
    1. Analyze review findings (critical / major only)
    2. Implement fixes for each finding
    3. Re-execute review (same criteria, same priority)
    review_count++

if review_count >= MAX_REVIEWS and verdict != "APPROVE":
    → Escalate to user
    → Display "Fixed 3 times but the following critical/major issues remain" + list of issues
    → Wait for user decision (continue / abort)
```

### Application in Breezing Mode

In Breezing mode, the **Lead** executes the review loop (see Phase B above):

1. Worker implements and commits in worktree → returns result to Lead
2. Lead reviews with Codex exec (priority) / Reviewer agent (fallback)
3. REQUEST_CHANGES → Lead sends fix instructions to Worker via SendMessage → Worker amends
4. After fix, re-review (up to 3 times)
5. APPROVE → Lead cherry-picks to main → Updates Plans.md to `cc:Done [{hash}]`

## Completion Report Format

A visual summary auto-output on task completion (after `cc:Done` + commit).
Designed to convey change content and impact even to non-technical stakeholders.

### Template

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓ Task {N} Done: {task name}                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                              │
│  ■ What was done                             │
│    • {change 1}                              │
│    • {change 2}                              │
│                                              │
│  ■ What changed                              │
│    Before: {old behavior}                    │
│    After:  {new behavior}                    │
│                                              │
│  ■ Changed files ({N} files)                 │
│    {file path 1}                             │
│    {file path 2}                             │
│                                              │
│  ■ Remaining issues                          │
│    • Task {X} ({status}): {content}  ← Plans.md  │
│    • Task {Y} ({status}): {content}  ← Plans.md  │
│    ({M} incomplete tasks in Plans.md)        │
│                                              │
│  commit: {hash} | review: {APPROVE}           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Generation Rules

1. **What was done**: Auto-extracted from `git diff --stat HEAD~1` and commit message. Minimize technical jargon, start with verbs
2. **What changed**: Infer Before/After from the task's "Content" and "DoD". Emphasize user experience changes
3. **Changed files**: Retrieved from `git diff --name-only HEAD~1`. Abbreviate with count when exceeding 5 files
4. **Remaining issues**: List `cc:TODO` / `cc:WIP` tasks from Plans.md. Indicate whether they are already in Plans.md
5. **Review**: Display review result (APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES → APPROVE)

### Reporting in Parallel Mode

- **1 task** (when forced with `--parallel`): Use Solo template
- **Multiple tasks**: Use Breezing aggregate template (see below)

### Reporting in Breezing Mode

Output collectively after all tasks are complete. Each task is listed in abbreviated form (what was done + commit hash only),
followed by an overall summary (total changed files + remaining issues):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓ Breezing Complete: {N}/{M} tasks          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                              │
│  1. ✓ {task name 1}            [{hash1}]     │
│  2. ✓ {task name 2}            [{hash2}]     │
│  3. ✓ {task name 3}            [{hash3}]     │
│                                              │
│  ■ Overall changes                           │
│    {N} files changed, {A} insertions(+),     │
│    {D} deletions(-)                          │
│                                              │
│  ■ Remaining issues                          │
│    {K} incomplete tasks in Plans.md          │
│    • Task {X}: {content}                     │
│                                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
