![Claude Harness](docs/images/claude-harness-logo-with-text.png)

**Turn Claude Code into a self-correcting development team.**

Claude Harness runs Claude Code in an autonomous **Plan → Work → Review** cycle,
catching mistakes before they ship.

## See It In Action

```bash
/plan-with-agent   # Brainstorm → Create a plan
/work              # Execute the plan (with parallel workers)
/harness-review    # Multi-perspective code review
```

**That's it.** Three commands turn a rough idea into reviewed, production-ready code.

## Why Claude Harness?

Solo developers face 4 recurring problems. Claude Harness solves all of them:

| Problem | What Happens | How Harness Fixes It |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Confusion** | "Where do I start?" | `/plan-with-agent` breaks ideas into actionable tasks |
| **Sloppiness** | Code quality drops under pressure | `/harness-review` runs 8 expert reviewers in parallel |
| **Accidents** | Dangerous commands slip through | Hooks auto-block `rm -rf`, protect `.env`, guard secrets |
| **Forgetfulness** | Past decisions lost between sessions | SSOT files + Claude-mem preserve context forever |

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements**: Claude Code v2.1.6+ ([compatibility guide](docs/CLAUDE_CODE_COMPATIBILITY.md))

### One-Liner Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness/main/scripts/quick-install.sh | bash
```

With development tools (AST-Grep, LSP):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness/main/scripts/quick-install.sh | bash -s -- --with-dev-tools
```

### Manual Install

```bash
# 1. Open your project in Claude Code
cd /path/to/your-project && claude

# 2. Install the plugin
/plugin marketplace add Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness
/plugin install claude-code-harness@claude-code-harness-marketplace

# 3. Initialize
/harness-init
```

**Done.** Start with `/plan-with-agent` to create your first plan.

<details>
<summary>Alternative: Local Clone</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness.git ~/claude-plugins/claude-code-harness
cd /path/to/your-project
claude --plugin-dir ~/claude-plugins/claude-code-harness
```

</details>

## What's New in v2.11

### Video Generation (v2.11.0)

**Auto-generate product demo, architecture, and release note videos from your codebase.**

```bash
/remotion-setup    # One-time Remotion setup
/generate-video    # Analyze → Plan → Generate (parallel)
```

| Video Type | Auto-detected When | Structure |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Product Demo | New project, UI changes | Intro → Feature Demo → CTA |
| Architecture | Major refactoring | Overview → Details → Data Flow |
| Release Notes | CHANGELOG updated | Version → Changes → New Feature Demo |

- **Codebase analysis**: Auto-detects framework, features, UI components
- **Smart scenario**: Suggests optimal video structure with AskUserQuestion
- **Parallel generation**: Up to 5 agents generate scenes simultaneously
- **Playwright integration**: Captures real UI interactions

> ⚠️ Remotion may require a paid license for commercial use

---

## What's New in v2.10

### OpenCode.ai Compatibility (v2.10.0)

**Use the Harness workflow with any LLM: o3, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, and more.**

```bash
/opencode-setup   # One-command installation
```

All core commands work in OpenCode.ai:
- `/harness-init` → Project initialization
- `/plan-with-agent` → Task planning
- `/work` → Parallel task execution
- `/harness-review` → Multi-perspective review

See [OpenCode Compatibility Guide](docs/OPENCODE_COMPATIBILITY.md) for details.

## Key Features

### Parallel Full-Cycle Automation

```bash
/work                  # Full automation with smart parallel (default)
/work --parallel 5     # Force 5 parallel workers
```

Runs **implement → self-review → fix → commit** in parallel for each task.
Each worker reviews its own code before marking done.

### Code Intelligence (AST-Grep + LSP)

```bash
/dev-tools-setup   # One-time setup
```

Enables structural code search and semantic analysis:
- Find code patterns: `console.log`, empty catch blocks, unused async
- Impact analysis: Find all references before refactoring
- Diagnostics: Type errors and warnings

### 8-Expert Code Review

```bash
/harness-review
```

Security, performance, accessibility, maintainability—8 specialists review your code simultaneously. Optionally add [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) for a second opinion.

### Safety Hooks

| Protected | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `.git/`, `.env`, secrets | Write blocked |
| `rm -rf`, `sudo`, `git push --force` | Confirmation required |
| `git status`, `npm test` | Auto-allowed |

### Session Continuity

- **SSOT files**: `decisions.md` (why) + `patterns.md` (how)
- **Claude-mem integration**: Past learnings persist across sessions
- **Session resume**: `/resume` restores your exact work state

### Cross-Session Communication

```bash
/session-broadcast "API changed: userId → user"
/session-inbox   # Check messages from other sessions
```

Real-time messaging between sessions. When you change an API in Session A, Session B gets notified automatically.

### MCP Server (Multi-Client Support)

```bash
/mcp-setup   # Configure for Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor
```

Use Harness from **Codex**, **Cursor**, or any MCP-compatible client. Share sessions across different AI tools working on the same project.

### OpenCode Compatibility

Harness works with [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai/) too. Use the same workflow with GPT, Gemini, or any supported model:

```bash
# Quick setup (no Claude Code required)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness/main/scripts/setup-opencode.sh | bash

# Or from Claude Code
/opencode-setup
```

See [opencode/README.md](opencode/README.md) for full setup instructions.
