![Claude Harness](docs/images/claude-harness-logo-with-text.png)

**Turn Claude Code into a self-correcting development team.**

Claude Harness runs Claude Code in an autonomous **Plan → Work → Review** cycle,
catching mistakes before they ship.

## See It In Action

```bash
/plan-with-agent   # Brainstorm → Create a plan
/work              # Execute the plan (with parallel workers)
/harness-review    # Multi-perspective code review
```

**That's it.** Three commands turn a rough idea into reviewed, production-ready code.

## Why Claude Harness?

Solo developers face 4 recurring problems. Claude Harness solves all of them:

| Problem | What Happens | How Harness Fixes It |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Confusion** | "Where do I start?" | `/plan-with-agent` breaks ideas into actionable tasks |
| **Sloppiness** | Code quality drops under pressure | `/harness-review` runs 8 expert reviewers in parallel |
| **Accidents** | Dangerous commands slip through | Hooks auto-block `rm -rf`, protect `.env`, guard secrets |
| **Forgetfulness** | Past decisions lost between sessions | SSOT files + Claude-mem preserve context forever |

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements**: Claude Code v2.1.6+ ([compatibility guide](docs/CLAUDE_CODE_COMPATIBILITY.md))

```bash
# 1. Open your project in Claude Code
cd /path/to/your-project && claude

# 2. Install the plugin
/plugin marketplace add Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness
/plugin install claude-code-harness@claude-code-harness-marketplace

# 3. Initialize
/harness-init
```

**Done.** Start with `/plan-with-agent` to create your first plan.

<details>
<summary>Alternative: Local Clone</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness.git ~/claude-plugins/claude-code-harness
cd /path/to/your-project
claude --plugin-dir ~/claude-plugins/claude-code-harness
```

## Key Features

### Parallel Full-Cycle Automation

```bash
/work --full --parallel 3
```

Runs **implement → self-review → fix → commit** in parallel for each task.
Each worker reviews its own code before marking done.

### 8-Expert Code Review

```bash
/harness-review
```

Security, performance, accessibility, maintainability—8 specialists review your code simultaneously. Optionally add [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) for a second opinion.

### Safety Hooks

| Protected | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `.git/`, `.env`, secrets | Write blocked |
| `rm -rf`, `sudo`, `git push --force` | Confirmation required |
| `git status`, `npm test` | Auto-allowed |

### Session Continuity

- **SSOT files**: `decisions.md` (why) + `patterns.md` (how)
- **Claude-mem integration**: Past learnings persist across sessions
- **Session resume**: `/resume` restores your exact work state

## Who Is This For?

| You | Benefit |
|-----|---------|
| **Solo developers** | Ship faster without sacrificing quality |
| **Freelancers** | Deliver review reports as proof of quality |
| **VibeCoder** | Build apps with natural language |
| **Cursor users** | 2-Agent workflow separates planning from coding |
