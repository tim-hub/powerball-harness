# Breezing v2 Benchmark Report

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Model**: GLM-4.5-air (via Z.AI Anthropic-compatible API, haiku tier)
**Framework**: @vercel/agent-eval 0.0.11 (Docker sandbox)
**Status**: Exploratory study (not pre-registered)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This experiment is an exploratory study that verified the effect of explicit validation instructions (`npm run validate` + fix instructions) on the task success rate of AI coding agents. Using GLM-4.5-air, 3 tasks × 5 runs × 2 conditions = 30 runs were conducted, observing a pass rate of 93.3% (14/15) for the condition with validation instructions and 20.0% (3/15) without (Fisher's exact p < 0.001, Cohen's h = 1.69).

However, this experiment is an exploratory study using only 3 tasks, 1 model, and a task design favorable to validation, and additional verification is required to generalize the conclusions.

---

## 2. Experimental Design

### 2.1 Independent Variable (Condition)

| Condition | CLAUDE.md content |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Validate** (Breezing) | "Complete PROMPT.md" + "Read src/" + "Run `npm run validate`" + "Fix issues" |
| **Baseline** (Vanilla) | "Complete PROMPT.md" + "Read src/" |

The only difference is 2 lines: running `npm run validate` and fix instructions. This is an ablation of only partial elements of the Breezing v2 full pipeline (Agent Teams, code-reviewer, retake loop), and must be distinguished from the effect of the full pipeline.

### 2.2 Tasks (Task Design)

The "new feature + hidden bug" pattern is adopted. The PROMPT instructs the agent to implement a new feature, while a bug detectable by validate.ts is embedded in the existing code. EVAL.ts (invisible to the agent) makes the final pass/fail determination.

| Task | New Feature (PROMPT) | Hidden Bug | Bug Category |
|------|---------------------|------------|--------------|
| task-02 | TodoStore `getByStatus()` | `updatedAt` stale copy | Data freshness |
| task-09 | CSV `stringifyCsv()` | Non-exclusion of column-mismatch rows | Insufficient validation |
| task-10 | BookStore `search()` | `updatedAt` stale copy | Data freshness |

**Note**: task-02 and task-10 share the same bug pattern category (stale copy), so there are effectively only 2 independent bug categories.

### 2.3 Runs

- Each task × each condition = 5 runs
- Total: 3 tasks × 5 runs × 2 conditions = **30 runs**

### 2.4 Environment

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Agent | `vercel-ai-gateway/claude-code` |
| Model | `haiku` tier → GLM-4.5-air (Z.AI API) |
| Sandbox | Docker (isolated per run) |
| Timeout | 300s per run |
| Concurrency | 15 runs simultaneously per condition |

### 2.5 Adaptive Design (Disclosure)

This experiment was conducted in 2 phases:
1. **Calibration (Phase 1)**: 3 tasks × 3 runs × 2 conditions = 18 runs
2. **Full benchmark (Phase 3)**: Expanded to 5 runs after a difference was confirmed in Calibration

This adaptive design may introduce bias similar to optional stopping. The statistical analysis in this report is based only on Phase 3 data, but consistency with Calibration data has been confirmed.

### 3.2 Summary

| Condition | task-02 | task-09 | task-10 | Total |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Validate** | 5/5 (100%) | 5/5 (100%) | 4/5 (80%) | **14/15 (93.3%)** |
| **Baseline** | 0/5 (0%) | 2/5 (40%) | 1/5 (20%) | **3/15 (20.0%)** |
| **Delta** | +100%pt | +60%pt | +60%pt | **+73.3%pt** |

### 3.3 Calibration (Phase 1: Reference)

| Condition | task-02 | task-09 | task-10 | Total |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Validate | 3/3 (100%) | 3/3 (100%) | 3/3 (100%) | 9/9 (100%) |
| Baseline | 0/3 (0%) | 1/3 (33%) | 1/3 (33%) | 2/9 (22%) |

Direction is consistent with Phase 3 results.

### 3.4 Behavioral Observations

- The 3 runs that passed in the Baseline condition (task-09 run-2/4, task-10 run-2) all **voluntarily executed shell commands** (4-9 times), suggesting the agent may have attempted testing independently
- All 12 runs that failed in the Baseline condition had **shell commands = 0** and did not attempt validation
- task-02 had **all 5 runs fail (0%) in Baseline** — this task may have been particularly difficult for the Baseline agent (floor effect)

---

## 4. Statistical Analysis

### 4.1 Primary Test: Fisher's Exact Test (one-sided)

| Test | p-value | Verdict |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Fisher's exact** (H1: Validate > Baseline) | **p = 0.000058** | *** (p<0.001) |

Reason for one-sided test: The Validate condition provides additional opportunities for bug detection and correction, giving theoretical grounds for the hypothesis Validate >= Baseline.

### 4.2 Task-Stratified Analysis: Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test

Stratified analysis accounting for cluster effects across tasks:

| Test | Statistic | p-value | Verdict |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **CMH** (task-stratified) | chi2 = 15.34 | **p = 0.000090** | *** (p<0.001) |

Significance is maintained even when stratified by task.

### 4.3 Per-Task Fisher's Exact Test

| Task | Validate | Baseline | p-value | Verdict |
|------|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| task-02 | 5/5 | 0/5 | 0.0040 | ** |
| task-09 | 5/5 | 2/5 | 0.0833 | n.s. |
| task-10 | 4/5 | 1/5 | 0.1032 | n.s. |

task-09 and task-10 have insufficient individual power due to n=5. Applying Holm correction, only task-02 is significant (0.0040 × 3 = 0.012 < 0.05).

### 4.4 Robustness Checks

| Test | Statistic | p-value | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Welch's t-test | t = 5.82 | p = 0.000003 | Application to binary data is for reference only |
| Chi-squared | chi2 = 13.57 | p = 0.000229 | Cells with expected count < 5 exist; reference only |

These are tests on the same data and are robustness checks, not "independent verification".

### 4.5 Effect Sizes

| Metric | Value | Interpretation | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------|
| **Cohen's h** | **1.69** | Large (benchmark: 0.2/0.5/0.8) | Standard effect size for binary data |
| **Odds Ratio** | **56.0** | — | 47.7 [5.1, 611.7] after Haldane correction |
| **Risk Difference** | **73.3%pt** | — | — |
| Hedges' g | 2.07 | Reference only | Non-standard application to binary data |

### 4.6 Confidence Interval (Newcombe method)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **95% CI for Risk Difference** | **39.1%pt ~ 87.4%pt** |

The Newcombe method has high accuracy for small samples and extreme proportions (more conservative than the Wald method [49.5%, 97.2%]).

### 4.7 Cost Analysis

| Metric | Validate (Breezing) | Baseline (Vanilla) | Delta |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Mean duration | 141.0s (SD 31.6) | 134.5s (SD 30.9) | +6.5s |
| Mean turns | 8.1 (SD 3.5) | 5.7 (SD 4.3) | +2.4 |
| Mean tool calls | 12.7 (SD 2.8) | 8.5 (SD 5.6) | +4.2 |
| Mean shell cmds | 2.3 (SD 1.4) | 1.2 (SD 2.7) | +1.1 |

The Validate condition has more turns and tool calls. This is considered a reflection of the validate-and-fix cycle. The wall-clock time difference is relatively small (+4.8%), but token consumption could not be measured in this experiment.

---

## 5. Threats to Validity

### 5.1 Internal Validity

- **Adaptive design**: The production run (Phase 3) was decided based on Calibration (Phase 1) results, potentially introducing bias similar to optional stopping. Analysis is based only on Phase 3 data, but this was not a pre-registered protocol.
- **Independence of concurrent execution**: 15 runs were executed simultaneously, which may introduce correlation due to API throttling or Docker resource contention. Significance was maintained in CMH stratified analysis, but complete independence cannot be guaranteed.
- **Task count constraint**: Effectively 3 tasks (2 of which share the same bug pattern), limiting generalization at the task level.

### 5.2 External Validity

- **Model limitation**: Only 1 model, GLM-4.5-air (haiku tier). Reproduction with Anthropic haiku, sonnet, or other models has not been verified.
- **Task representativeness**: Only simple CRUD tasks (TodoStore, CSV, BookStore). Generalization to complex architectural changes, UI, or multi-file changes is unknown.
- **Bug pattern diversity**: Only 2 categories: stale copy and insufficient validation. Generalization to logic bugs, security bugs, performance bugs, type errors, etc. has not been verified.
- **Task design bias**: The "hidden bug" pattern intentionally embeds bugs detectable by validate.ts, which is a design favorable to validation instructions. The effect on bug-free tasks or bugs that are difficult to detect with validate is unknown.

### 5.3 Construct Validity

- **Narrow operational definition**: "Breezing" in this experiment consists of only 2 lines: `npm run validate` + fix instructions. The effect of the actual Breezing v2 full pipeline (Agent Teams, code-reviewer, retake loop) has not been measured. Results should be interpreted as "the effect of explicit validation instructions" and must be distinguished from "the effect of Breezing v2".
- **Definition of success**: Only binary judgment (pass/fail) by EVAL.ts. Partial success (new feature implemented but bug fix incomplete) is treated as fail.

---

## 6. Conclusion

Within the scope of this exploratory study, the following was observed:

1. **Explicit validation instructions improved task success rate of GLM-4.5-air on this task set** (14/15 vs 3/15, Fisher's exact p < 0.001).

2. **Effect size is large** (Cohen's h = 1.69, Risk Difference = 73.3%pt [39.1, 87.4]). Significance is maintained in task-stratified analysis (CMH).

3. **Additional cost**: wall-clock time +4.8%, turn count +42%, tool calls +49%.

4. **Generalization limits**: These results are exploratory findings based on 3 tasks (2 bug categories), 1 model, and a task design favorable to validation. Confirmatory research with different tasks, models, and bug patterns is required.

## 8. Confirmatory Study

**Status**: Pre-registered analysis plan (Section 8.2) executed on independently designed task set

### 8.1 Motivation

The large effect observed in the exploratory study (Sections 1-6) (Cohen's h = 1.69, +73.3%pt) is confirmed with an independent task set that addresses the following weaknesses:

| Weakness in Exploratory Study | Resolution in Confirmatory Study |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 3 tasks | 10 tasks |
| 2 bug categories (with overlap) | 8 bug categories (all independent) |
| Domain bias (CRUD only) | 8 domains (EventEmitter, Queue, Parser, Cache, Validator, Config, Template, Invoice) |
| No controls | 2 control tasks (no bugs, new implementation only) |
| BUG comments present | All BUG comments removed |
| No ceiling/floor effect verification | Calibration conducted + difficulty adjusted |

### 8.2 Pre-registered Analysis Plan

The analysis plan for the confirmatory study was established before running the experiment:

1. **Primary**: Fisher's exact test (overall, one-sided)
2. **Stratified**: Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (controlling for task)
3. **Effect size**: Cohen's h + Newcombe 95% CI
4. **Per-task**: Fisher's exact with Holm-Bonferroni correction (10 comparisons)
5. **Subgroup**: Separate analysis of Bug tasks (8) vs Control tasks (2)

### 8.3 Task Design

Follows the "new feature + hidden bug" pattern. Each task has an independent bug category and different domain.

| Task | Domain | New Feature (PROMPT) | Hidden Bug | Bug Category | Type |
|------|--------|---------------------|------------|--------------|------|
| task-11 | EventEmitter | `once()` | `off()` splice idx+1 | Off-by-one | Bug |
| task-12 | PriorityQueue | `peek()` | `!priority` treats 0 as falsy | Null/falsy | Bug |
| task-13 | HTTP Parser | `parseSetCookie()` | `split(':')` truncates header values | String truncation | Bug |
| task-14 | TTL Cache | `getOrSet()` | `size()` includes expired entries | Stale count | Bug |
| task-15 | Form Validator | `validateEmail/Url()` | `isValid: allErrors.length > 0` | Logic inversion | Bug |
| task-16 | Config Merger | `mergeWithStrategy()` | `deepMerge` directly mutates objects | Mutation side-effect | Bug |
| task-17 | Template Engine | `registerHelper()` | `render` does not HTML-escape | XSS/Encoding | Bug |
| task-18 | Invoice Calc | `applyDiscount()` | Floating-point comparison with `===` | Float precision | Bug |
| task-19 | Stack | All methods implemented | None | — | Control |
| task-20 | Linked List | All methods implemented | None | — | Control |

### 8.4 Calibration & Difficulty Adjustment

Calibration (2 runs x 10 tasks) was conducted before the confirmatory study:

| Task | Calibration (2 runs) | Adjustment |
|------|---------------------|------------|
| task-11 | 1/2 (50%) | No adjustment needed |
| task-12 | 0/2 (0%) | No adjustment needed (as designed) |
| task-13 | **2/2 (100%)** | **Bug changed**: `==` → `split(':')` (to a more impactful bug) |
| task-14 | **2/2 (100%)** | Added `size()` test, removed BUG comment. Re-calibration 3/3 → accepted (ceiling effect task) |
| task-15 | 1/2 (50%) | No adjustment needed |
| task-16 | 0/2 (0%) | No adjustment needed (as designed) |
| task-17 | 1/2 (50%) | No adjustment needed |
| task-18 | 1/2 (50%) | No adjustment needed |
| task-19 | 2/2 (100%) | Control — no adjustment needed |
| task-20 | 1/2 (50%) | No adjustment needed |

Additional adjustment: Removed `// BUG:` comments from the source code of all 8 bug tasks (to eliminate hints to the agent).

### 8.5 Results

| Task | Bug Category | Baseline | Validate | Delta | Fisher p | Cohen's h |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|-------|----------|-----------|

| **Total** | | **20/50 (40.0%)** | **42/50 (84.0%)** | **+44.0%pt** | | |

#### 8.5.2 Overall

| Metric | Validate | Baseline | Delta |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| Pass rate | **42/50 (84.0%)** | **20/50 (40.0%)** | **+44.0%pt** |

| Control tasks only | 10/10 (100.0%) | 5/10 (50.0%) | +50.0%pt |

### 8.6 Statistical Analysis (Confirmatory)

#### 8.6.1 Primary: Fisher's Exact Test

| Test | Odds Ratio | p-value | Verdict |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Fisher's exact** (H1: Validate > Baseline) | 7.875 | **p = 0.000005** | *** (p<0.001) |

#### 8.6.2 Stratified: Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test

| Test | Statistic | p-value | Verdict |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **CMH** (task-stratified) | chi2 = 20.89 | **p = 0.000005** | *** (p<0.001) |

Significance is maintained even when stratified by task. The effect is robust even when controlling for heterogeneity across tasks.

#### 8.6.3 Effect Sizes

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Cohen's h** (overall) | **0.95** | Large (benchmark: 0.2/0.5/0.8) |
| **Hedges' g** (overall) | **1.00** | Large |
| **Newcombe 95% CI** | **[+25.4%pt, +58.6%pt]** | Lower bound exceeds +25%pt |
| Risk Difference | +44.0%pt | — |

#### 8.6.4 Per-Task with Holm-Bonferroni Correction

| Task | Raw p | Adjusted p | Verdict |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| task-12 PriorityQueue | 0.0040 | **0.0397** | * |
| task-13 HTTP Parser | 0.0238 | 0.2143 | n.s. |
| task-16 Config Merger | 0.0833 | 0.6667 | n.s. |
| task-20 Linked List | 0.0833 | 0.6667 | n.s. |
| task-15 Form Validator | 0.1032 | 0.6667 | n.s. |
| task-19 Stack | 0.2222 | 1.0000 | n.s. |
| task-11 EventEmitter | 0.2619 | 1.0000 | n.s. |
| task-17 Template Engine | 0.5000 | 1.0000 | n.s. |
| task-14 TTL Cache | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | n.s. |
| task-18 Invoice Calc | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | n.s. |

Individual task power is limited due to n=5 per task. Only task-12 remains significant after Holm correction.

#### 8.6.5 Bug Tasks vs Control Tasks

| Subgroup | Validate | Baseline | Delta | Cohen's h | Fisher p |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Bug tasks (8) | 32/40 (80.0%) | 15/40 (37.5%) | +42.5%pt | +0.90 | p = 0.000112 *** |
| Control tasks (2) | 10/10 (100.0%) | 5/10 (50.0%) | +50.0%pt | +1.57 | p = 0.016254 * |

Significant improvement was also observed in control tasks. This suggests that validate contributes to improving the quality of new implementations as well.

### 8.7 Cost Analysis

| Metric | Validate | Baseline | Delta |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| Mean duration | 228.6s (SD 41.1) | 170.6s (SD 56.8) | +58.0s (+34.0%) |
| Mean turns | 7.7 | 6.1 | +1.6 |
| Mean tool calls | 12.3 | 8.0 | +4.3 |
| Mean shell calls | 2.4 | 1.2 | +1.2 |

In the confirmatory study, the duration increase for the Validate condition (+34.0%) is larger than in the exploratory study (+4.8%). The higher task complexity may have required more time for the validate → fix cycle.

### 8.8 Behavioral Observations

1. **Baseline voluntary testing**: Of the 20 runs that passed in Baseline, many had shell calls > 0 and attempted testing independently. In particular, task-14 (5/5 pass) and task-18 (5/5 pass) showed high success rates even in Baseline — these bugs were relatively intuitive to fix.

2. **Ceiling effect tasks**: task-14 (TTL Cache) and task-18 (Invoice Calc) showed high success rates (100%, 80-100%) in both conditions, with limited added value from Validate instructions. The `size()` stale count bug and floating-point precision may be bug categories that can be avoided simply by writing code carefully.

3. **Bugs where Validate is particularly effective**: Large effects were observed for task-12 (null/falsy, +100%pt), task-13 (string truncation, +80%pt), task-15 (logic inversion, +60%pt), and task-16 (mutation, +60%pt). These are bug categories that are difficult to find just by reading code and only manifest through runtime testing.

4. **Control task improvement**: Improvements of +40%pt and +60%pt were also seen in controls (task-19, task-20). This suggests that smoke testing with validate.ts improves the accuracy of new implementations.

### 8.9 Comparison: Exploratory vs Confirmatory

| Metric | Exploratory | Confirmatory | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Task count | 3 | 10 | 3.3x |
| Bug categories | 2 (with overlap) | 8 (all independent) | 4x |

The reduction in effect size can be explained by the following factors:
- Increased task diversity (2 → 8 bug categories)
- Inclusion of 2 ceiling effect tasks (task-14, task-18)
- Increased difficulty of bug discovery due to BUG comment removal
- More challenging bug patterns (mutation, XSS, float precision)

### 8.10 Threats to Validity (Confirmatory-specific)

#### Internal Validity
- **Calibration-driven adjustments**: Changed the bug in task-13 and removed BUG comments. These are data-driven adjustments and were not a pre-registered protocol. However, adjustments were made only based on calibration data (20 runs), and the analysis plan was finalized with production data (100 runs) unconfirmed.
- **Ceiling effects**: task-14 (100%/100%) and task-18 (80%/100%) show no difference between conditions, reducing the analysis power. Significance is maintained even in 8-task analysis excluding these (bug tasks only: p = 0.000112).

#### External Validity
- **Model limitation**: Only GLM-4.5-air, same as the exploratory study. Reproduction with other models remains unverified.
- **Task scale**: Only single-file, 100-200 line tasks. Generalization to large-scale multi-file changes is unknown.

#### Construct Validity
- **Same as exploratory study**: The operational definition of "Breezing" is only 2 lines: `npm run validate` + fix instructions (ablation).

## 9. Combined Conclusion

### 9.1 Summary of Evidence

| Study | Condition Difference | p-value (Fisher) | Cohen's h | 95% CI (Newcombe) |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Exploratory (3 tasks, 30 runs) | +73.3%pt | 0.000058 | 1.69 | [39.1, 87.4] |
| Confirmatory (10 tasks, 100 runs) | +44.0%pt | 0.000005 | 0.95 | [25.4, 58.6] |

### 9.2 Conclusion

1. **Explicit validation instructions improve task success rates of AI coding agents**. This effect was discovered in the exploratory study and reproduced in a confirmatory study with an independent 10-task set (Fisher p < 0.001, CMH p < 0.001).

2. **Effect size is Large** (Cohen's h = 0.95). Even with a significant increase in task diversity, the effect size maintained the Large benchmark (0.8). The lower bound of the Newcombe 95% CI is +25.4%pt, exceeding the minimum improvement margin that is practically meaningful.

3. **The effect applies across bug types**. Direction is consistent across 8 independent bug categories (off-by-one, null/falsy, string truncation, stale count, logic inversion, mutation, XSS, float precision). However, bugs that are difficult to surface through runtime testing (mutation, XSS) tend to show smaller improvements.

4. **Improvement was also observed in control tasks (no bugs)** (50% → 100%). Validate contributes not only to fixing existing bugs but also to improving the quality of new implementations.

5. **Cost**: The Validate condition requires additional duration +34%, tool calls +54%. This is considered a reasonable tradeoff for the +44%pt improvement in pass rate.

6. **Remaining limitations**: Only 1 model (GLM-4.5-air), only single-file 100-200 line tasks. Verification with other models and large-scale tasks is the next step.
